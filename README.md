During the corona pandemic the consultancy services are deeply affected , Today if we face any minor health issue then we refrain ourselves from going to doctors due to corona outbreak , so we were motivated by the thought that what if we bring all Doctors onlinr for consultary  purposes , and not only doctors this could be extended to any professional that can deliver a valueable check thorugh an online mode.Through this initiative we tried to build a platform where both a consultant and user and register and a user can explore all the consultancies available for his/her need around his/her area .The user can book appointments with the consutants online by paying the consultant fees set by the consultant and once the payment is done the consulsulant can proceed to provide his/her services to the user
