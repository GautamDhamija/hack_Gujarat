# HACK GUJARAT
During the corona pandemic the consultancy services are deeply affected , Today if we face any minor health issue then we refrain ourselves from going to doctors due to corona outbreak , so we were motivated by the thought that what if we bring all Doctors onlinr for consultary  purposes , and not only doctors this could be extended to any professional that can deliver a valueable check thorugh an online mode.Through this initiative we tried to build a platform where both a consultant and user and register and a user can explore all the consultancies available for his/her need around his/her area .The user can book appointments with the consutants online by paying the consultant fees set by the consultant and once the payment is done the consulsulant can proceed to provide his/her services to the user

### CHALLENGES AND FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
The major chanlenge was to design the backend for this project as each consultant had its database as well as user and the medium to integrate both using appointments was brainstorming.
Then the Frontend part using the react technologies and login system that we designed coveres every possible mistake a user can do while registering and logining in stages , all this is well handleled with alert System.
